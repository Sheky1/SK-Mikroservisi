# Microservices

A full stack project made for a course in my university. The frontend was done in React, and the backend was done in Spring Boot, using multi services. API Gateway and Eureka were used for the communication between the three services made. The application is used for making flight ticket reservations, with the three microservices being for users, flights and reservations.
